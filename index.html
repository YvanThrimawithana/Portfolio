        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Yvan Thrimawithana and I am a NSBM Undergrad following a degree in Computer Security (affiliated with the university of Plymout) . With a strong background in web development, I have a deep understanding of technologies such as C#, JSP, and Servlet. I am also well-versed in mobile app development using Flutter and Firebase engineering.

          In addition to my technical skills, I have experience working with IoT sensors and have successfully developed a prototype for a smart traffic management system. My education at Lyceum, where I completed my Ordinary Level and Advanced Level examinations, has provided me with a solid foundation to excel in my career.
          
          I am always eager to learn new things and constantly strive to acquire new skills. My passion for technology and drive to stay updated with the latest advancements in the industry has helped me stay at the forefront of my field. 
          
          Aside from my professional endeavors, I am a team player with excellent communication skills. I believe in the power of collaboration and have a proven track record of delivering successful projects in a team environment. To maintain a healthy work-life balance, I prioritize my physical well-being by playing badminton and hitting the gym</p>
